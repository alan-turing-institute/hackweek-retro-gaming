## How to play

<img align="right" width="500" height="400" src="./reg-game/img/regina_quest_start.png">

- You play as _Regina_ and can move her by using the standard directional keys
- You need to protect the terminals that _Maisy Malware_ will try to attack
- You can stop Maisy for several seconds by trapping her in one of your three sandbox which you can drop using the `space` key
- If Maisy reaches a terminal, you have 10 seconds to reach that terminal and stop the attack
  - If you reach the terminal in time, you play a mini game where you need to connect the two computers by rotating the circuits to create a valid path. You have 15 seconds to do this!
- The game runs for 30 seconds and you need to have a positive score to win
